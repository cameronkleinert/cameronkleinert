            <br>My Geocaching Profile.com</h1>
        <div class="casestudy_monitor">

        </div>
        <div class="casestudy_intro">In 2007, I co-created, designed, and developed mygeocachingprofile.com from scratch. The site is a tool used by geocaching
            hobbists to generate an attractive set of images detailing their geocaching adventures and feats. For example,
            the site produces statistics about how many geocaches the user has found, graphs detailing when the finds were
            made, maps showing where the finds were made, award badges for completing community challenges, and much more.
            The site was a success and eventually we decided to sell it to Groundspeak, Inc. Groundspeak is the company that
            runs the entire geocaching game. They integrated some of my code into their main geocaching.com site and then
            decided to also keep the original mygeocachingprofile.com site live and hired me to maintain it, develop new
            content, and support its user base. I continue in that role today.

        <h2 class="casestudy_sectiontitle">I Learned How to Handle a Full Stack Development Project</h2>
        <div class="casestudy_section">
            Creating mygeocachingprofile.com meant developing across the full development stack. I originally worked with a 3rd party
            hosting platform to serve the site and later teamed with the development team at Groundspeak to migrate everything
            to their internal servers. I configured IIS to host the site and control file access and security permissions.
            I created a MS SQL Server database to store user data and wrote SQL to query the data. The site uses ASP.NET
            coded in C# for the bulk of its server side logic and the front-end is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            My strongest skills lie in front end development, but producing a site from scratch and working across the full
            stack has been invaluable for understanding how websites work.

        <h2 class="casestudy_sectiontitle">I Learned How to Handle Complex XML Parsing</h2>
        <div class="casestudy_section">All Geocachers have access to a personal XML file from the geocaching.com site that contains information about the
            geocaches they've found. Mygeocachingprofile.com allows users to upload that file and then kicks off a process
            where the XML file is read and analyzed. The XML data is used to generate statistics, charts, maps, badges, and
            more. Designing and programming this process taught me how to properly crawl through XML files. That knowledge
            has been useful in working with the more popular modern-day JSON format used by APIs.

        <h2 class="casestudy_sectiontitle">I Learned How to Create, Design, and Maintain a MS SQL Database</h2>
        <div class="casestudy_section">
            Mygeocachingprofile.com has tens of thousands of users each with their own authentication credentials, preferences, and geocaching
            data. All of this information is held and secured in a MS SQL database. Designing, building, and using this relational
            database has given me experience with the MS SQL application, writing SQL queries, securing frontend inputs from
            database attacks, and developing code that more efficiently handles database connections.

        <h2 class="casestudy_sectiontitle">I Learned How to Code Several Data Visualization Tools</h2>
        <div class="casestudy_section">Each geocacher has a huge amount of data associated with their caching activity. Geocaching data includes the types
            of geocaches found, the dates those caches were originally placed and found, latitude/longitude of the cache
            locations, ratings of the find difficulty and terrain difficulty, and much more. Geocachers want to see this
            data analyzed and presented in a logical and attractive way. I've programmed several visualization tools to present
            this data and the project has provided me a deeper understanding of the art and science of data visualization.
            I've worked with charts, graphs, lists, maps, statistical analysis, dynamic color shading, and have tackled the
            challenge of creating tools that are scalable for any geocaching data set.

        <h2 class="casestudy_sectiontitle">I Learned How to Use Shapefiles to Analyze and Present Geospatial Data</h2>
        <div class="casestudy_section">Shapefiles are a mapping format developed to hold geographic information along with associated shape vectors. They
            can be queried for information. For example, one can find out which country shape contains a certain latitude/longitude.
            Their data can also be extracted into a programmatic object, styled, and drawn to an image. These characteristics
            made them perfect for locating geocaching finds on various maps and then drawing maps for users to enjoy.
            <br>
            <br> After working on mygeocachingprofile.com for years, I’m now well versed in the shapefile format, GIS tools for
            reading shapefiles, the Sharpmap .NET helper library, and complex geometric calculations to find where shapes
            intersect. I also have gone down many geographic rabbit holes including the several historical county divisions
            in England, the true nationalities of very small Caribbean islands, and disagreements over the county line demarcations
            in Texas!

        <h2 class="casestudy_sectiontitle">I Learned How to Support and Engage a 30,000+ User Base</h2>
        <div class="casestudy_section">As mygeocachingprofile.com has grown, I've had to build a support infrastructure for my users. I built a Help and
            FAQ page, a contact form for submitting questions and suggestions, and a blog and facebook page for announcing
            updates. Each week, I engage directly with my users by answering questions and considering suggestions for the
            site. I've learned how to identify common questions and then redesign parts of the site to decrease confusion
            and thereby decrease support emails. Direct engagement with the community has been invaluable for understanding
            how geocachers use the site and what type of features they want to see in the future.
